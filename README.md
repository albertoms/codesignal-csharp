# CodeSignal C#

I'm using Visual Studio Code to solve the challenges using the TDD approach. For each exercise, I took some of the testing values (input and expected output) to recreate the test in my local environment using xUnit. This enabled me to try more ideas and debug faster than writing the code directly in the CodeSignal editor.

## Running tests

This is how I run the complete test suite:

```
> dotnet test
```
